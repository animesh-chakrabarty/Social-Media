# Social Media Platform Assignment
<sub>Please thoroughly read the instructions before starting the assignment.</sub>
## Overview

You are tasked with developing a Social Media Platform that includes the following features:
- User engagement score calculation.
- Content moderation.
- User feed.

This assignment will help evaluate your skills in both backend and frontend development, focusing on programming logic and database management.

## Setting up the DotNet API

1. Open a terminal in the root directory (Where Program.cs file is)
2. Either run the command `dotnet run` or use any IDE (Visual Studio, vscode) to run the API

## Setting up the Angular application

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Social-Media-frontend` directory
2. Run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run the command `ng serve` to start the Angular application

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:4200/`

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Engagement Score Calculation:**
   - Implement a function to calculate a userâ€™s engagement score based on their activity (posts, likes, comments).
   - Show the engagement score of All Users on a Page and Sort them in Descending Order.
    - The engagement score is calculated as follows:
    `Engagement Score = (Number of Posts * 5) + (Number of Likes * 2) + (Number of Comments * 3)
    `

2. **Content Moderation:**
   - Implement logic to automatically flag inappropriate content based on a list of banned words.
    ```csharp
    var bannedWords = ["monolith", "spaghettiCode", "goto", "hack", "architrixs", "quickAndDirty", "cowboy", "yo", "globalVariable", "recursiveHell", "backdoor", "hotfix", "leakyAbstraction", "mockup", "singleton", "silverBullet", "technicalDebt"]
    ```
    - Provide feedback to users when their content is flagged when creating a post, or comment.
    - Do not allow the user to post the content if it contains any banned words.

3. **User Feed**
   - Show a feed page with a list of posts, likes, and comments from all users.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Data Consistency and Integrity:**
   - Ensure data is accurate and consistent.

2. **Code Quality:**
   - Write clean, readable, and maintainable code following best practices.

3. **Testing:** (Optional)
   - Include unit tests to verify the functionality of the application.


## Database Schema

Here is the SQLite schema for the Social Media Platform:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    UserName TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Posts (
    PostID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    UserID INTEGER,
    Content TEXT NOT NULL,
);

CREATE TABLE Likes (
    LikeID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    UserID INTEGER,
    PostID INTEGER,
);

CREATE TABLE Comments (
    CommentID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    UserID INTEGER,
    PostID INTEGER,
    Content TEXT NOT NULL,
);
```

A SQLite database file `SQLLiteDatabase.db` is included in the project with some sample data.
You can view the database using a SQLite plugin in IDE or any other tool of your choice.

### .NET Web API

- Implement controllers for managing users, posts, likes, and comments.
- Should include basic CRUD operations and custom endpoints for specific functionalities.
- Add Services for Talking to the SQLite Database

An Example `PostController` and `PostService` are Already Made for You.


### Angular Frontend
- Show Feed Page with a list of posts, likes, and comments from All Users. `UserFeedComponent`
  The Feed Page should show the following:
    - Posts with the User's Name and Content
    - Likes with the User's Name and Post's Content
    - Comments with the User's Name and Post's Content
  Functionality:
    - Like a Different User's Post
    - Comment on a Different User's Post
    - Content Moderation: Show a Message if the Comment being made contains any Banned Words
- Show User Engagement Score Page with a list of Users and their Engagement Scores. `UserEngagementComponent`
  Functionality:
    - Show the User's Name and Engagement Score
    - Sort the Users in Descending Order of Engagement Score
- Show Page for Creating, Editing, and Deleting Posts for the Current User. `PostListComponent`
  Functionality:
    - Create a Post
    - Content Moderation: Show a Message if the Post being made contains any Banned Words
    - Edit a Post
    - Delete a Post
- Create Services for Talking to the .NET Web API
- Make Simplistic User Interface for the Social Media Platform (You can use Angular Material for this, or any other UI Library of your choice or even plain CSS)
- Make Additional Components and Services as Needed.
An Example `PostListComponent` and `PostService` are Already Made for You with some functionality.


## Example Flow
- User Engagement Score Calculation:
Calculate and display the engagement score for each user based on their activity (posts, likes, comments).

- Content Moderation:
Flag inappropriate content automatically and provide feedback to users.

- User Feed:
Generate and display a Feed for user interactions, including the number of posts, comments, likes received, and given.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues while setting up solution, try the following:
- Either run the command `dotnet run` or use any IDE (Visual Studio, vscode) to run the API
- Run the command `ng serve` to start the Angular application inside the `Social-Media-frontend` folder, after installing the necessary packages through `npm`
- If you are unable to set up the angular application, you can use the tools like postman or curl to test the API and Complete Half of the Assignment
- Make sure you have the latest versions of .Net 7 SDK, Node.js, and npm installed, appropriate Angular version.
- Check that the API is running and accessible at `http://localhost:5182/swagger/index.html`, or the appropriate port if you have changed it.
- If you get a CORS error, make sure that the correct origins are allowed in the API
